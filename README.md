Lunch Order Application
Greg Bevington, 2023, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology

This C# application enables users to place and customize lunch orders, offering a selection of main courses with optional add-ons. 
The program calculates both the subtotal and total, including a 5% tax. 
The primary objectives of this assignment were to gain practical experience working with various form controls, implement code for conditional processing, and create methods for efficient calculations.

Developed using Visual Studio, this application provides an interactive environment for users to test its functionality. 
To explore and run the program, simply open the project in a C# equipped Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio and execute it.
